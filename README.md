# Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Optimization
This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations to identify key factors and provide actionable insights for reducing cancellations, optimizing pricing strategies, and improving revenue management in the hospitality industry.

## About the Project
The hospitality industry faces significant challenges due to high cancellation rates, which lead to revenue losses and inefficient room utilization. This project aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations, identify contributing factors, and provide actionable insights to mitigate cancellations. The study covers data from City Hotel and Resort Hotel between 2015 and 2017, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of trends and their impact on business performance.

## Business Problem
City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been experiencing high cancellation rates, leading to reduced revenue and inefficient hotel room usage. Our objective is to analyze cancellation patterns and provide business recommendations to optimize revenue generation and hotel occupancy rates.

## Assumptions
1. No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 have significantly impacted the data.
2. The data remains relevant for making future business decisions.
3. There are no unexpected drawbacks to implementing the suggested solutions.
4. Hotels are not currently using any of the proposed strategies.
5. Booking cancellations are the primary factor affecting revenue efficiency.
6. Cancellations lead to vacant rooms for the reserved period.
7. Clients make reservations and cancellations within the same year.
